This is due to limitations in the connected CRMs' APIs. </li> <li>If you have just created it and the CRM server usually doesn't reflect the change immediately. Some CRMs have refresh clock to update all changes every X seconds/minutes.

This interface powers the following key features:</p> <ul> <li>call pop</li> <li>call logging</li> <li>sms logging</li> </ul> <p>This interface can return zero, one or more contacts. If multiple contacts are returned, App Connect will prompt the end user to select the specific contact to be used when logging calls. </p> <p>If no contact is found, do not create a contact in its place. When logging calls, if no contacts are found associated with a phone number, then the framework to prompt the user to create a contact. The user will enter a name, and then call the createContact interface, and then call the createCallLog with the newly created contact ID. </p> <p>This interface is called in the following circumstances:</p> <ul> <li>When a call is received.</li> <li>When a user manually clicks the \"refresh contact\" action for a contact or phone call. </li> <li>When a user accesses App Connect the first time in an attempt to perform an initial contact match operation for recent phone calls. </li> </ul> <p> </p> The \"Refresh contact\" action in App Connect's contact list"},{"location":"developers/interfaces/findContact/#request-parameters","title":"Request parameters","text":"Parameter Description <code>user</code> An object describing the Chrome extension user associated with the action that triggered this interface. <code>authHeader</code> The HTTP Authorization header to be transmitted with the API request to the target CRM. <code>phoneNumber</code> The phone number to search for within the target CRM, provided in an E.164 format, e.g. +11231231234. <code>overridingFormat</code> (Optional) If defined by the user under advanced settings, this will contain alternative formats the user may wish to use when searching for the <code>phoneNumber</code> <p>Alternative formats</p> <p>Some CRM's have very restrictive APIs with regards to searching for phone numbers, meaning they require an exact match in order to find a contact with that phone number.

Some CRMs have more rudimentary APIs that require phone numbers to EXACTLY match the string searched for. For these CRMs, reliably finding a contact record for a phone number can be difficult, which in turn impacts your ability to log a call and associate it with the proper entity in your CRM. Let's look at an example to help you understand. The following phone numbers are all functionally equivalent, even though they are not literally identical. </p> <ul> <li><code>(###) ###-####</code></li> <li><code>###.###.####</code></li> <li><code>###-###-####</code></li> <li><code>+1-###-###-####</code></li> <li>etc</li> </ul> <p> </p> A setting used to search for contacts using a variety of alternative formats used by the customer. <p>RingCentral phone numbers are all formatted using the E.164 standard.
