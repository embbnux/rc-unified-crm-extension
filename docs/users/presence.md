# Presence and status

Using the embedded phone provided by App Connect one can easily set their presence and/or status and instantly have that synced across the network. Similarly, your presence status will always be reflected in your embedded dialer as it changes via mechanisms outside of the extension. 

There are two ways to change your status:

* Click the presence indicator in the upper-left corner of the embedded dialer

     ![Change presence](../img/presence.png)

* Navigate to the Settings page under the more menu and modify it from there

     ![Change presence from settings](../img/presence-settings.png)

## Call queue presence

If a user is part of a call queue, App Connect allows them to manage their call queue presence in the status settings section.

* **Accept calls from call queue**: When disabled, the user will not receive calls from any call queue.

     ![Accept call queue calls](../img/call-queue-presence.png)

* **Manage call queue presence**: Allows the user to opt out of receiving calls from specific call queues.

!!! tip "The user must have the appropriate permissions to change their call queue presence, and the call queue must be configured to allow members to update their presence in the RingCentral admin portal."
